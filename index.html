    <h1>Processing Community Day @ Denver</h1>
    <img src="images/pcd-rafael.gif" alt="Processing Community Day Denver web banner animation by Rafael Fajardo.">
    <p>PCD @ Denver is an inclusive event that will bring together people of all ages to celebrate and explore art, code, and community. The day-long event features workshops, community sharing, and a lot of inspiration! Remember, Processing Community Day is just as much about inviting in new people to creative coding as it is about gathering current lovers of Processing.</p>
    <p>The morning workshop will introduce P5.js as a tool for anyone, even if you have not programmed before to start being creative with code. The middle of the day will have spaces for community show and tell and other guests to share inspiration. Additional Workshops in the afternoon will dive into specific topics like playing with sound, webcams, or animation. Throughout the day you will have time to meet other members of the community!</p>
