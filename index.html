    <h1>Processing Community Day @ Denver</h1>
    <img src="images/pcd-rafael.gif" alt="Processing Community Day Denver web banner animation by Rafael Fajardo.">
    <p>PCD @ Denver is an inclusive event that will bring together people of all ages to celebrate and explore art, code, and community. The day-long event features workshops, community sharing, and a lot of inspiration! Processing Community Day is just as much about inviting in new people to creative coding as it is about gathering current lovers of Processing. The PCD team is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neurotype, physical appearance, body, age, race, ethnicity, nationality, language, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.</p>
    <p>The morning workshop will introduce P5.js as a tool for anyone, even if you have not programmed before. The middle of the day will have spaces for community Show and Tell and other guests to share inspiration. Additional workshops in the afternoon will dive into specific topics like playing with sound, webcams, or animation. Throughout the day you will have time to meet other members of the community!</p>

	<h2>What is Processing?</h2>
	<p><a href="https://processing.org/" target="_blank">Processing</a> is a flexible software sketchbook and a language for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts. Since 2001, Processing has promoted software literacy within the visual arts and visual literacy within technology. There are tens of thousands of students, artists, designers, researchers, and hobbyists who use Processing for learning and prototyping.</p>
	<p>The mission of the <a href="https://processingfoundation.org/" target="_blank">Processing Foundation</a> is to promote software literacy within the visual arts, and visual literacy within technology-related fields — and to make these fields accessible to diverse communities. The goal is to empower people of all interests and backgrounds to learn how to program and make creative work with code, especially those who might not otherwise have access to these tools and resources. Processing does this by developing and distributing a group of related software projects, which includes <a href="https://processing.org/" target="_blank">Processing (Java)</a>, <a href="http://p5js.org/" target="_blank">p5.js (JavaScript)</a>, and <a href="https://py.processing.org/" target="_blank">Processing.py (Python)</a>, and facilitating partnerships and collaborations with allied organizations and individuals, to build a more diverse community around software and the arts. <a href="https://day.processing.org/" target="_blank">Processing Community Day</a> is happening around the globe and is a key part of this outreach and community building.
